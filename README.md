The rules of the game are:
1. A word will be randomly selected from our database, and you need to guess the word.
2. The vowels of the word will be visible to you.
3. You will have 10 tries to guess the word.
4. You will get a hint after 5 wrong guesses if you want, but if you take a hint, your remaining guesses will reduce by three.
